NOTE

This is a fork of the suds project to add Python 3 support.
It was made to my own needs and was published to maybe save some pain of
those on the same situation.
It has been tested only in Python 3.3 and only for the explicit needs I had.
There are absolutely no guarantees that this fork will ever receive another update.
The original project's license is also applied to this fork, of course.

OVERVIEW
